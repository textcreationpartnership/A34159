            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>THat a <hi>Phyſician</hi> was naturally brother to the Wormes, becauſe he was engendred out of Mans Corruptions.</p>
               <p>He adviſeth all men to be kind and cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous to Hemp: being askt the reaſon, quoth he, it is the moſt revengeful thing in the World: for if a man bear it, eſpecially in <hi>Bridewel,</hi> it is a hundred to one but it will be the death of him ſhortly after.</p>
               <p>Standing by ſome Swearing at Play, he ſaid, He that ſwears when he looſeth his Money by Gameing may challenge Hell by way of Purchaſe,</p>
               <p>He ſaid a Prodigal was like a Bruſh, which ſpent it ſelf to make others go handſome in their Apparrel.</p>
               <p>Seing a man in the <hi>Pillory,</hi> he ſaid, That certainly there muſt be a great deal of pleaſant Oratory in it,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:57784:81"/> or elſe men would not have their Ears nailed to it.</p>
               <p>He ſaid, That Antiquaries love every thing as <hi>Dutch-men</hi> do Cheeſe, for being mouldy and Worm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaten.</p>
               <p>He contradicted one for ſaying, That the Players in <hi>Paris</hi> had but an idle employment, ſure <hi>Sir</hi> ſaid he you are miſtaken, for their whole lives are nothing but Action.</p>
               <p>Being asked by one, how he ſhould uſe Tobacco that it might do him good, he anſwered, You muſt keep a Tobacco-ſhop and ſell it, for certainly there are none elſe find good in it.</p>
               <p>He ſaid, That Poetry and Plain dealing were a cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of handſome Wenches, and he that wedds him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to either, ſhall dye a Beggar.</p>
               <p>He compared Women to Quick ſands which ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed firm, but if a Man came upon them he fell in over Head and Shoulders.</p>
               <p>Of all Trades he ſaid, A Tooth-drawer was the moſt unconſcionable, becauſe his Trade was to take away that, whereby every man gets his living. And that a Hang-man's Profeſſion was the moſt contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plative of all others, becauſe he never was at work, but he was put in mind of his own end.</p>
               <p>Seeing ſome Reapers in Harveſt time, he told them, That Corn was a quarrelſome Creature, becauſe it roſe by the <hi>Blade,</hi> and fell by the <hi>Ears</hi> with thoſe that cut them.</p>
               <p>That Colliers and Mine-workers ſhould be well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with all the <hi>Philoſophical Secrets</hi> of the Earth becauſe they have deeper knowledge in it then any others.</p>
               <pb n="56" facs="tcp:57784:82"/>
               <p>That Drawers and Tapſters ſhould be men of great eſteem, Becauſe they are men not only of an high Calling, but alſo of a great reckoning.</p>
               <p>Of all Knaves (he ſaid) there was the greateſt hope of a Cobler, For though he be ever ſo idle a Fellow yet he is always mending.</p>
               <p>One time ſeeing a tall Man, he ſaid, That for cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain he muſt needs be a great <hi>Polititian,</hi> becauſe he had an extraordinary reach.</p>
               <p>He ſaid, a ſquint eyed Man could not but be very Circumſpect, Since he looked ſo many ways at once.</p>
               <p>That Glaſiers might be choſen, and concluded good deciders of Controverſie or Arbitrators, For they ſpend moſt of their time in compoſing of quarrels.</p>
               <p>That Carpenters were the Civilleſt and honeſteſt of all men, For they never do their buſineſs without a Rule.</p>
               <p>That Phyſicians of all men had the beſt on't, For if they did well the World did proclaim it, if ill, the Earth did cover it.</p>
               <p>That Vintners are very raſh fellows becauſe they draw upon all occaſions: and ſo expert at their Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons that they let very few go away ſcot-free.</p>
               <p>That Fidlers are very unfortunate in their occupa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, For they never do any thing but it is againſt the hair.</p>
               <p>That Trumpeters are ever ſubject to Diſtempers, For commonly when they are moſt in health, they will fall a ſounding.</p>
               <p>That Oſtlers and Horſe-courſers are happy men, For let the World go how it will, and let there be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo much alteration in times and perſons, yet they are ſtill to be accounted Stable-men.</p>
               <pb n="57" facs="tcp:57784:82"/>
               <p>A perſon Drunk one day railing at him, he told the Company He mattered not any thing what he ſaid in his Cups, For he ſpake nothing that he could ſtand to.</p>
               <p>He ſaid, ſome Taylors were like Wood-cocks, becauſe they lived by their long Bills.</p>
               <p>That a Priſon is a good Inſtrument of Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, for it makes many Rogues and Lewd Fellows, Stayd men. Diſcourſing of a Common-wealth he ſaid, That in that of Fiſhes there are many Officers, <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring</hi> is the King, The <hi>Sword-fiſh</hi> his Guard, <hi>Lob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters</hi> Aldermen, <hi>Crabs</hi> Cunſtables, <hi>Dog-fiſh</hi> Serjeants; and their Yeomen, and <hi>Poor John,</hi> or <hi>Stock-fiſh</hi> the common ſort of people.</p>
               <p>That Coblers might be ſaid to be good men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they ſet men upright, and are ever employ'd in mending Souls.</p>
               <p>He ſaid, that a Tavern and Houſes of Entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment were the only places for men to thrive in, For he ſaid, He had ſeen many a ſcore made there.</p>
               <p>That Carriers are wiſe men, for they will not med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle with any thing, but they will know of what mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and weight it is.</p>
               <p>That Painters were cunning Fellows, For they had a Colour for what ever they did.</p>
               <p>He ſaid, that Court-gallants had reaſon to be good Scholars, By reaſon they were deep in many Books:</p>
               <p>One was ſaying to him, that ſome Letters in the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Alphabet were longer then any other what ever: That<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>s not ſo ſaid he, for in ours we have one, an <hi>L</hi> long.</p>
               <p>That Glovers get a great part of their living, by cutting Purſes, and are never puniſh'd for it.</p>

               <p>Seeing on a time a man with a great Noſe and thin Beard, he ſaid that the ſhadow of that mans long Noſe hindered the growth of his Beard.</p>
               <p>Hearing of a Wench (that was bred on the Alms of the Pariſh) who had left one of her Baſtards to be kept by them alſo, I commended her, ſaid he, for her gratitude; having done like the grateful Stork in <hi>Holland,</hi> For it is reported of them, that they never depart but leave one of their young behind them, in recompence of the kindneſs they received from their Land-lord.</p>
               <p>He was wont to ſay, That the <hi>Portuguiſe</hi> ſeems a Fool and is ſo, the <hi>Spaniard</hi> ſeems wiſe and is a Fool, the <hi>French</hi> ſeems a fool and is wiſe; the <hi>Engliſhman</hi> is wiſe but cannot ſhow it, and the <hi>Dutchman</hi> would be wiſer, were it not for his Liquor.</p>

                  <p>IT is cuſtomary among the Nobility, and perſons of great quality in <hi>France</hi> to lye in Chambers apart from thoſe of their Ladies.

<pb n="102" facs="tcp:57784:105"/> with his Noſe into every Bed, for it ſeems this Lady was well ſented. There was one of whom he at length might have ſome grounds of ſuſpition; becauſe beſides his Complection which never fail'd of an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent inclination to the Female Sex, he was beſides both a handſome and a very ſubtle Fellow, but he could not tell which Bed he lay in; by chance groping up and down in the dark he found his Bed, and pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling up the Cloathes ſmelt a perfume he was very well acquainted with; and from thence judged this muſt be the Rogue that had done him this diſhonour; wherefore that he might be ſure to know him the next day, he took out of his Pocket a pair of Sizers, and ſnipt off one of his Whiskers, for then it was the Faſhion to wear them. This Fellow was awake, and by this knew very well his Maſter, and his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, firſt by ſmelling, and then by marking him, that he might be known the next day, to prevent which as ſoon as his Maſter was gone, he inſtantly ſtarts up; and going into all the Chambers aforeſaid cuts off from every one that had any that Whisker that was on the ſame ſide of the Mouth that his was on, and returns to his own Bed. The Servants getting up next morning, and ſeeing each others right Whisker gone ſtood ſtareing one upon another like ſo many diſtracted Bedlamites, not knowing what to ſay, or whom to accuſe. In ſhort, one that was known ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently to be an arch Rogue was ſuſpected, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon ſome of the more paſſionate fell upon him and abuſed him moſt pitifully, others took his part, by which means they were all engaged by the Ears: at the noiſe hereof the whole Houſe was alarm'd and running to ſee what was the matter, they were ſo
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:57784:105"/> ſurprized with the ſtrangeneſs of ſuch a Comical ſight, that laying aſide all reſpect to their Lord and Lady, that they laught beyond meaſure. Sure it muſt be very pleaſant to ſee two ſuch contrary Paſſions, in one entire Company, proceeding from one and the ſame cauſe. Theſe poor <hi>Semi-barbarians</hi> finding themſelves laught at by their fellows, whom they ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved not ſo abuſed as they were, imagining them the Plotters of this miſchief, and without examining whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it was ſo or no, diverted the quarrel among themſelves upon the others. Now did the Cumbat be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin afreſh, with more eagerneſs than before, which cauſed one to run and tell the Lord, that there was a Civil War Commenced among his Servants, and that if he came not quickly and decide the Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie their fury would utterly leave him deſtitute of his preſent Attendants. Hereupon his Lordſhip commanded a Ceſſation of Arms, and that they ſhould preſently come before him, hereupon they went and cleanſed themſelves from the Blood each Face, by Fighting, had contracted; for as they then were, one Face could hardly be diſtinguiſht from the other, and then came and appeared before their Lord in the great Hall. In the mean time he ordered his Lady to be there. Upon the appearance of the men, my Lord and Lady were poſſeſt with the ſame different Paſſions as their Servants were; for the firſt was in a Fury to ſee that Traitor who had abuſed him; whilſt the other fell into the greateſt laughter imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable: after a little time the half Whiskers made a bitter complaint againſt the whole whiskers, as to the injury they had ſuſtained in the abuſe of their beards; the Defendants aledged that they were guiltleſs of
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:57784:106"/> the Fact, and that for their good will in coming to part them they were Aſſaulted by them. To end the Controverſie, in ſhort, ſaid my Lord, it was I that cut off one Whisker whoſoever is the owner thereof I will have his Head off too for an irreparable inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry he hath done me, their former paſſion was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted into another of that fear, ſo that now their Knees wag'd more then their Hands before: look here (ſaid my Lord) whoſe remaining Whisker match<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth this in Colour, he is the Subject of my revenge. Hereupon Carrats fell on his knees, and beg'd his Pardon, confeſſing the whole Truth; for this witty indeavour of concealment he gave him his Life with the loſs of his Ears, and delivered him over to the abuſed <hi>Semi-whiskers</hi> who got a Blanket and toſt him ſo long in Revenge, that they had like to toſt his bones out of his skin as well as out of his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips.</p>

                  <p>There was a Smith who lived oppoſite to this Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemans Window, through which, every morning very early, for the benefit of the freſh Air, he uſed to look out, which this Vulcanian Raſcal took notice of; and being before bribed by ſome Officers for his Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion, he thought of a way how to betray this poor Gentleman into their Clutches.

<pb n="118" facs="tcp:57784:113"/> acquainted her Parents with the Love he bore their Daughter, who no ſooner heard it, but were in a great Paſſion, their ambition judging him to mean a Fortune, and therefore not only refuling his offer, but verily uncivilly forbade him the Houſe: ſaying, <hi>Moreover, that if it ſhould be their misfortune, &amp; his imaginary happineſs to ſteal a Marriage and rob them of their Daughter, he would never give them a farthing.</hi> He obeyed their commands in that, but reſolved notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding that he would ſee his Miſtreſs whatever came on't, Love ſoon found out a way to effect it, at which interview he told her what had paſt between him, and her Parents, and the refuſal of the Match propoſed; ſhe ſeemed exceedingly troubled hereat, and wept bitterly, the other to comfort her, ſwore if ſhe would be conſtant, he would never forſake her; and to ſhew the reallity and integrity of his Affection offered to Marry her immediatly, ſhe conſented, and being Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with all convenient ſpeed, they performed the rights of <hi>Hymen,</hi> and ſent her home to her Fathers Houſe, deſiring her not to take any Notice of what had paſt, and ſince the time of their being together was ſo ſhort the Old ones could not ſuſpect any thing.</p>
                  <p>A few days after this new married Gentleman got his (ſuppoſedly Maiden) Wife into his company and having repeated his former delights, he told her, he would go into the Countrey, giving her directions where to ſend to him, and that if ſhe prov'd with Child, and that her Parents ſhould diſcover it, as that they would quickly do, that then ſhe ſhould diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble the greateſt grief imaginable, and when preſt very much to diſcover the Father, ſhe ſhould then confeſs it was ſuch a one, who had formerly made Love to her,
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:57784:113"/> but her Parents would not accept of the Motion; as for the reſt ſaid he, leave the whole management to me.</p>
                  <p>Upon this they parted, and ſhe proved with Child according to his expectation. The Mother perceiving the frequent Pewkings of her Daughter, with the ſwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of her Belly, took her into a private place &amp; there conjured her to tell her the naked Truth, whether ſhe was not with Child? The Daughter with many ſighs and tears confeſſed that ſhe was, and that ſuch a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman living in the Countrey had done it: the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther like a Woman diſtracted, firſt lockt up her Daughter, and then ran to her Husband and calling him aſide, told him of the ſhame and Infamy, that hath befaln his Family, and by whom; this unexpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed news made him ten times madder then his Wife; but at lenth they both concluded that it was but a folly either to rave or raile at their Daughter, but to ſtudy ſome means to ſauder up the crack of their Daughters Honour. No better expedient was thought on, but to write to the Gentleman and accquaint him with what he had done, requiring ſatisfaction; this Letter was ſent, and another return'd by him in An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer thereunto; to this Effect, That it is true, he had lain with their Daughter, but he knew not whether he got her with Child, for ſhe that can diſpence with being a Whore to one, will be ſo to another. In ſhort he concluded, that he had no more to ſay then this, <hi>That if ſhe would be ſo impudent to lay the Child to him he muſt maintain it, but as for her part, he had nothing to ſay to her, for he had already over-paid her that little pleaſure he had purchaſed of her.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This return netled them to the heart, and ſhow'd
